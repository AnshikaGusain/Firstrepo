Hello there !! 
This is Anshika Gusain.
I have updated it using terminal.

Using 'newfeature' branch instead of 'main' branch

git commands in terminal
1. git clone <repository http or ssh>
2. git add <file name>
3. git add .        (This will add all the files)
4. git commit -m <message>
5. git status    (To know the changes or status of repository)
6. git push	(It will reflect changes in repository)
7. git pull 	(It will load up-to-date files after changes)
8. git diff    (It will show the changes you made)(This command is used before git add.)
9. git diff --staged (It will show the changes after the file is staged)
-------------------------------------------------------------
To work in another branch
1. git branch  (Show all the available branches)
2. git branch <branch name> (Add a new branch)
3. git checkout <branch name>  (Switch to another branch)
4. git push will not work, use git --set-upstream origin <branch name>
5. After discussing the changes we can merge new branch in the main branch and delete the new branch.
6. git merge main (It will pull all the changes made in main to the branch)
