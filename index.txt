Hello there !! 
This is Anshika Gusain.
I have updated it using terminal.

Using 'newfeature' branch instead of 'main' branch

git commands in terminal
1. git clone <repository http or ssh>
2. git add <file name>
3. git add .        (This will stage new and modified, not deleted)
   git add -A      (This will stage all)
   git add -u      (This will stage modified and deleted, not new)
4. git commit -m <message>
5. git status    (To know the changes or status of repository)
6. git push	(It will reflect changes in repository)
7. git pull 	(It will load up-to-date files after changes)
8. git diff    (It will show the changes you made)(This command is used before git add.)
9. git diff --staged (It will show the changes after the file is staged)
10. git reset <file-name> (It will reset all the commits you made to the previous commit)
    then, git checkout <file-name>
11. git log (Show all the commits)
12. touch .gitignore (All the files included in it will get ignored)
-------------------------------------------------------------
To work in another branch
1. git branch  (Show all the available branches)
2. git branch <branch name> (Add a new branch)
3. git checkout <branch name>  (Switch to another branch)
4. git push will not work, use git --set-upstream origin <branch name>
5. After discussing the changes we can merge new branch in the main branch and delete the new branch.
	git branch -d <branch name>   (It will get deleted from your computer not from remote)
	git push origin --delete <branch-name>  (To delete from remote)



6. git merge main (It will pull all the changes made in main to the branch)
------------------------------------------------------------------
